"By design, Python installs to a directory with the version number embedded, "
"e.g. Python version 2.7 will install at :file:`C:\\\\Python27\\\\`, so that "
"you can have multiple versions of Python on the same system without "
"conflicts. Of course, only one interpreter can be the default application "
"for Python file types. It also does not automatically modify the "
":envvar:`PATH` environment variable, so that you always have control over "
"which copy of Python is run."

"Typing the full path name for a Python interpreter each time quickly gets "

"The second (:file:`Scripts`) directory receives command files when certain "

"install or configure anything else to use Python. Having said that, I would "
"strongly recommend that you install the tools and libraries described in the"
" next section before you start building Python applications for real-world "
"use. In particular, you should always install Setuptools, as it makes it "
"much easier for you to use other third-party Python libraries."

"The most crucial third-party Python software of all is Setuptools, which "
"extends the packaging and installation facilities provided by the distutils "
"in the standard library. Once you add Setuptools to your Python system you "

"A Virtual Environment is a tool to keep the dependencies required by "
